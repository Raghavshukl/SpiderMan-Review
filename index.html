    <div class="review">
        <p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 takes everything that made the first game so great and builds on it in every way. One of the most notable improvements is to the traversal system. Web-swinging is still as exhilarating as ever, but Insomniac has added a number of new moves and mechanics that make it even more fun and satisfying to get around the city.</p>

        <div class="highlights">What I Loved About the Traversal:</div>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>The webbed wings are a fantastic addition, allowing gliding through the air for long distances.</li>
                <li>The slingshot mechanic lets you launch off walls, providing excellent mobility and momentum.</li>
                <li>Overall, the traversal system is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying, making swinging through the city a joy.</li>
                <li>The new moves and mechanics enhance the experience and add depth to both traversal and combat.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a must-play for fans of superhero and open-world games. Its outstanding traversal mechanics, along with the game's depth and excitement, make it one of the best gaming experiences in years.</p>
        <h1>Gameplay</h1>
        <div class="gameplay">
            <p>OVERALL I really liked SPIDER MAN 2 as it bring a lot to the table for Insomniac games and another masterpiece in their collection it was very innovative to bring 2 Spider man in one game </p>

        </div>
        <h1>Character</h1>
        <div class="character">
            <p>The characters in the game were very cool. Kraven was one of the best side villains in the history of gaming. MJ was nice; she really helped as a side character in assisting both Spider-Man. I have nothing to say about Spider-Man as both of them were amazing.</p>
